My PhD and postdoctoral research on population and community ecology focused on the ways in which individual level variation translates to population level patterns. I asked questions about the role of intraspecific life history variation in population extinction, competitive coexistence, community assembly, and local adaptation. 

My research combined theoretical models and statistical analyses with ecological data to understand how incorporating simple assumptions of variation can have complex effects on our expectations for population and community dynamics. I used complementary mathematical and statistical approaches that are both strongly tied to natural systems, creating a unified framework integrating population and community models with frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches.

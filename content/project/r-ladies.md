RLadies is a world-wide network of meetup groups for people who identify with a gender minority. We encourage people to learn and use R as well as become more involved int he R community. 

As the founder and organizer of the local Los Angeles branch of RLadies, I held monthly meetups that highlighted the work of local women, lead attendees through a tutorial, or explored an advanced topic.

# Welcome!

I'm an applied statistician / data scientist, working in both R and Python, with over 11 years of programming experience and 9 peer reviewed publications. I'm fascinated by the ways variability enters a mechanistic process, changing the patterns that emerge in data. I focus on computational approaches for both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks to account for stochasticity in mathematical models. 

I am an organizer for [RLadies](https://rladies.org/), a global network of meetup groups to support gender diversity in the R community. I live with two rescue pups, who I think are really bears just pretending to be dogs. I spend most of my free time drinking coffee, hiking with the doggos, and watching baseball.
